    
There should be 5 red triangles on 5 black squares above

This test checks that drawImage and readPixels are not effected by gl.Pixelstorei(gl.PACK_ALIGNMENT) and visa versa

FAIL pixel in 3d context at (20,15) is (0,0,0,255), should be (255,0,0,255)
FAIL pixel in 2d context at (0,0) is (0,0,0,0), should be (0,0,0,255)
PASS PACK_ALIGNMENT is 1
